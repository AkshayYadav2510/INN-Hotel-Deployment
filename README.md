Overview
This project aims to predict whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or not based on historical booking data. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze key features such as customer information, booking details, and payment methods to classify bookings as likely to be cancelled or not. This helps hotel management make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation, customer outreach, and revenue optimization.
